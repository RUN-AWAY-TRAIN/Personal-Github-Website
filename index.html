    <H3>About Me</H3>
    <p>
        Just as a parasite burrows deep until it becomes almost inseperable from the host, so too has creativity burrowed deep into the back of my skull.<br />
        As a child, my symptoms were incessant day dreaming and relentless nightmares. The parasite has matured, as has the host, and my symptoms have evolved.<br />
        Now I simply spend every waking moment thinking about the content of the endless number of text files on my computer
        <!--Wait, is there an easter egg in my website? Huh, didn't see that coming.-->
